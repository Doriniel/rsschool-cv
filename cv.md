## 👩🏻‍🦰 About me
Hi, I'm Maria, 30 y.o. I strongly believe in a lifelong learning path. I'm sure that anyone can change his or her profession if paying enough efforts and determination.

I received a specialist's degree in chemistry at the university, but since then have tried a lot of different professional areas, including nonprofit and digital marketing. Last few years I was working as a digital performance manager in media agencies. Working quite close to an IT sphere I've decided to give it a try and started learning front-end development. 

My core strengths lie in attention to the details, creativity and curiosity.
My colleagues considered me as a person with highly developed soft skills, including ability to easily communicate with anyone.
I like reading, coffee and crocheting.
